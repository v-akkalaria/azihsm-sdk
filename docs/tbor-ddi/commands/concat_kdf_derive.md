# ConcatKdfDerive (Opcode 0x1D)

**Handler:** `fw/core/lib/src/ddi/tbor/concat_kdf_derive.rs`
**Session:** InSession

## Description

Derives key material (AES or HMAC) from a caller-held **masked** ECDH
shared secret (from [`EcdhDerive`](./ecdh_derive.md)) via a single-step
"concatenation" KDF, and returns the derived key as a **masked** blob under
the requested scope's masking key.  Two variants are selected by `kdf_alg`:

| `kdf_alg` | KDF | Hash input |
|---|---|---|
| `1` | ANSI X9.63 (SEC 1 §3.6.1) | `Hash(Z ‖ counter ‖ SharedInfo)` |
| `2` | NIST SP 800-56A r3 one-step (§5.8.2.1) | `Hash(counter ‖ Z ‖ OtherInfo)` |

Both hash the shared secret `Z`, a 4-byte big-endian block counter (from
1), and a single info octet string, concatenating the per-block digests and
truncating to the derived key length; they differ only in field order.
Unlike [`HkdfDerive`](./hkdf_derive.md), a single-step KDF takes only one
info string (no salt).

The device unmasks the input secret **in place** in the request buffer,
checks that its kind is an ECDH shared secret (`Secret256` / `Secret384` /
`Secret521`) carrying the `derive` usage attribute, runs the selected KDF
into scratch, re-masks the output key under the target scope, and scrubs
the recovered secret and the derived scratch on every path.  This is a
**TBOR-only** command (no MBOR analogue).

An **empty** `info` omits the `SharedInfo` / `OtherInfo`.

The derived-key blob records the output key kind, `local` usage plus
`encrypt`/`decrypt` (AES) or `sign`/`verify` (HMAC), the requested scope,
and the platform `{svn, owner}` identity.

Available to **both Crypto-Officer and Crypto-User** sessions.

## Request

### TOC entries

| Offset | Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | `session_id` | `session_id` (inline) | Session this request is bound to; cross-checked against the SQE-carried session id. |
| — | `scope` | `u8` (inline) | [`KeyScope`] whose masking key wraps the derived key. |
| — | `hash_algo` | `u8` (inline) | [`HashAlgo`] driving the KDF (`1` = SHA-256, `2` = SHA-384, `3` = SHA-512). |
| — | `kdf_alg` | `u8` (inline) | [`ConcatKdfAlg`] variant (`1` = X9.63, `2` = SP 800-56A). |
| — | `key_type` | `u8` (inline) | [`KdfKeyType`] output key type (AES-128/192/256 = `10`/`11`/`12`; HMAC-SHA-256/384/512 = `25`/`26`/`27`; variable HMAC-256/384/512 = `30`/`31`/`32`). |
| — | `key_length` | `u8` (inline) | Output length in bytes for the `VarHmac*` types; `0` means absent (required for `VarHmac*`, ignored otherwise). |
| 8 | `masked_secret` | `buffer` (260..=294 B) | The masked ECDH shared secret IKM; unmasked in place. |
| — | `info` | `buffer` (0..=256 B) | Optional `SharedInfo` (X9.63) / `OtherInfo` (SP 800-56A); empty means none. |

### Data section

Carries the masked secret, followed by the info.

## Response

### TOC entries

| Offset | Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | `masked_key` | `buffer` (244..=356 B) | The derived key, masked (AEAD-GCM-256) under the scope's masking key. |

### Data section

Carries the masked derived key.  The masked length is `228 + okm_len`,
where `okm_len` is the derived key length (16 / 24 / 32 for AES-128/192/256;
32 / 48 / 64 for HMAC-SHA-256/384/512; `key_length` for `VarHmac*`).

## Errors

| Error | Cause |
|---|---|
| `SessionNotFound` | `session_id` does not refer to an `Active` slot |
| `InvalidArg` | Unknown `hash_algo` or `kdf_alg`, or a non-`Session` scope requested before the partition is `Initialized` |
| `InvalidKeyType` | Unknown / unsupported `key_type`, a `VarHmac*` output with `key_length = 0`, or the input blob is not an ECDH shared secret |
| `InvalidKeyLength` | A `VarHmac*` `key_length` outside the per-variant range (256: 32..=64, 384: 48..=128, 512: 64..=128) |
| `InvalidPermissions` | The input secret's `derive` usage attribute is not set |
| `UnsupportedKeyScope` | The requested target scope's masking key is not provisioned |
| `MaskedKeyDecodeFailed` / `AesGcmDecryptTagDoesNotMatch` | The masked secret is malformed or fails authentication (wrong scope / tampered) |
| `ConcatKdfError` | The underlying single-step KDF failed |
| `DefaultPskMustRotate` | The calling role's PSK is still the compiled-in default (dispatcher, pre-handler) |
| `DdiDecodeFailed` | Malformed request body |
