# UnwrapKey (Opcode 0x14)

**Handler:** `fw/core/lib/src/ddi/tbor/unwrap_key.rs`
**Session:** InSession

## Description

Implements `CKM_RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP` for the TBOR transport: within an open
session, unwrap a host-supplied wrapped-key blob with the partition's
RSA-2048 **unwrapping** key and return the recovered key as a **masked**
blob under the requested scope's masking key. This is the TBOR analogue
of MBOR `RsaUnwrap`, but it re-masks the recovered key (unmask-on-use)
instead of vaulting it under a key handle. Nothing is persisted on the
device on success; the handler uses the undo log only to guarantee the
**transient** vault key (staged while re-masking) is deleted if a later
step fails.

The host first calls [`GetUnwrappingKey`](./get_unwrapping_key.md) to
obtain the partition's RSA-2048 unwrapping public key, then wraps the
key to import as `RSA-OAEP(KEK) ‖ AES-KWP(key)`: a random KEK is
RSA-OAEP-encrypted to the unwrapping key, and the key material is
AES-KWP-wrapped under that KEK. The device resolves the unwrapping
**private** key internally by the partition's `RSA_UNWRAPPING_KEY_ID`
property (no host key reference), OAEP-decrypts the KEK, AES-KWP-unwraps
the payload, decodes it into vault form, and masks it.

`key_class` selects the decode path (and the recovered key's vault kind);
`key_usage` selects the recovered key's usage attributes, which the device
validates against the class:

- `Aes` → raw 16 / 24 / 32-byte AES key; `encrypt`+`decrypt` only.
- `Rsa` → DER RSA private key (non-CRT vault kind); `sign`+`verify` or
  `encrypt`+`decrypt`.
- `RsaCrt` → DER RSA private key (CRT vault kind); `sign`+`verify` or
  `encrypt`+`decrypt`.
- `Ecc` → PKCS#8 DER ECC private key; `sign`+`verify` or `derive`.
- `HmacSha256` / `HmacSha384` / `HmacSha512` → raw variable-length HMAC
  key stored as the matching `VarLenHmacSha*` vault kind; `sign`+`verify`.

`sign`+`verify` and `encrypt`+`decrypt` are matched pairs and exactly one
usage group may be set; any invalid pairing, multi-usage request, or usage
not permitted for the class is rejected with `InvalidPermissions`.

Imported keys are never `local`. For the asymmetric classes (`Rsa`,
`RsaCrt`, `Ecc`) the recovered key's wire public key is re-derived and
returned in `pub_key`; symmetric classes (`Aes`, `HmacSha*`) return an empty
`pub_key`.

Scope → masking key (resolved on-device):

- `Session` → the per-session masking key (works for any Active session,
  including before `PartFinal`).  **Platform note:** provisioned only on
  the std/emu PAL today; the Uno (hardware) PAL returns `UnsupportedCmd`
  from `session_masking_key`, so `scope = Session` fails on hardware until
  session-key masking is implemented — target a persisted scope
  (`Local` / `SecurityDomain`) on Uno.
- `Ephemeral` → the partition `PartitionEphemeralMaskingKey`.
- `Local` → the partition `PartitionLocalMaskingKey`.
- `SecurityDomain` → the security-domain masking key (`SDMK`).

The `Ephemeral` / `Local` masking keys are provisioned by `PartFinal`, and
the `SecurityDomain` masking key by `CreateSD`.  Requesting any of these
scopes before its masking key is provisioned is rejected with
`UnsupportedKeyScope` ("the requested scope has no masking key yet").

Available to **both Crypto-Officer and Crypto-User** sessions.

## Request

### TOC entries

| Offset | Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | `session_id` | `session_id` (inline) | Session this request is bound to; cross-checked against the SQE-carried session id. |
| 8 | `scope` | `uint8` (inline) | Requested key scope (`KeyScope` discriminant): `1` = Session, `2` = Ephemeral, `3` = Local, `4` = SecurityDomain. |
| 12 | `key_class` | `uint8` (inline) | Class of the wrapped key (`KeyClass` discriminant): `0` = Aes, `1` = Rsa, `2` = RsaCrt, `3` = Ecc, `4` = HmacSha256, `5` = HmacSha384, `6` = HmacSha512. |
| 16 | `key_usage` | `uint64` (offset/len) | Requested usage permissions (`KeyUsage` bitfield): `0x01` = encrypt, `0x02` = decrypt, `0x04` = sign, `0x08` = verify, `0x10` = derive, `0x20` = wrap, `0x40` = unwrap. Validated against `key_class`. |
| 20 | `oaep_hash_algo` | `uint8` (inline) | OAEP hash used to wrap the KEK (`HashAlgo` discriminant): `1` = SHA-256, `2` = SHA-384, `3` = SHA-512. |
| 24 | `wrapped_blob` | `buffer` (≤ 3072 B) | The RSA-AES-wrapped key: `RSA-OAEP(KEK) ‖ AES-KWP(key)`. The leading modulus-sized (256 B for RSA-2048) OAEP ciphertext is wire little-endian. |
| 28 | `key_label` | `buffer` (≤ 128 B) | Caller-supplied label recorded in the masked-key metadata; empty for an unlabeled key. |

### Data section

Carries the eight-byte little-endian `key_usage`, followed by the
wrapped-key blob and key label.

## Response

### TOC entries

| Offset | Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

| 12 | `masked_key` | `buffer` (≤ 3168 B) | The recovered key, masked (AEAD-GCM-256) under the scope's masking key: `header(8) ‖ iv(12) ‖ aad(192) ‖ pt(key) ‖ tag(16)`. Not stored on-device. |
| 16 | `pub_key` | `buffer` (≤ 520 B) | The recovered key's wire public key for RSA (`n_le ‖ e_le`) / ECC (`x ‖ y`); empty for symmetric (AES / HMAC) keys. |

### Data section

Carries the masked key followed by the public key (empty for symmetric
keys).

## Errors

| Error | Cause |
|---|---|
| `SessionNotFound` | `session_id` does not refer to an allocated slot, or the slot is not `Active` |
| `InvalidArg` | An unknown `oaep_hash_algo` |
| `UnsupportedKeyScope` | The requested scope has no masking key yet (`Ephemeral` / `Local` before `PartFinal`, or `SecurityDomain` before `CreateSD`) |
| `UnsupportedCmd` | An unknown `key_class` discriminant |
| `InvalidPermissions` | The requested `key_usage` is an invalid pairing, sets more than one usage group, or is not permitted for `key_class` |
| `PendingKeyGeneration` | The partition's unwrapping key is still being generated; call `GetUnwrappingKey` and retry |
| `RsaUnwrapInvalidRequest` | The wrapped blob is shorter than the modulus-sized OAEP segment |
| `RsaUnwrapInvalidKek` | The recovered KEK has an invalid length |
| `RsaDecryptFailed` | OAEP-decrypt of the KEK failed (wrong unwrapping key, corrupt ciphertext, or `oaep_hash_algo` mismatch) |
| `DefaultPskMustRotate` | The calling role's PSK is still the compiled-in default (dispatcher, pre-handler) |
| `DdiDecodeFailed` | Malformed request body |
