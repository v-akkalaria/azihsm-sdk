//! Per-ENGINE ownership of engine-supplied EVP method copies, shared by
//! [`pkey_method`](crate::pkey_method), [`hkdf_method`](crate::hkdf_method)
//! and [`asn1_method`](crate::asn1_method).
//!
//! The engine framework **frees** whatever method the `pkey_meths` /
//! `pkey_asn1_meths` callback hands out when that ENGINE is destroyed
//! (`engine_pkey_meths_free` / `engine_pkey_asn1_meths_free` run right before
//! the destroy hook), so every ENGINE must own its own method copy per NID —
//! a shared process-global method would be freed at the first engine's
//! destruction and dangle for every other engine. Three rules keep the table
//! sound:
//!
//! - [`MethodTable::register`] **overwrites** an existing `(engine, nid)`
//!   entry: one can only pre-exist if a destroyed ENGINE at the same address
//!   was never released — it is necessarily stale.
//! - The lookup **never stores** on a miss: a miss means the entry was
//!   already released, i.e. this lookup is the framework's destruction-time
//!   free pass — it is handed a throwaway copy to free (inserting it would
//!   leave a dangling entry that a reused ENGINE address would later pick
//!   up).
//! - [`MethodTable::release`] drops the engine's entries address-only,
//!   dereferencing nothing — the framework frees the methods itself.
