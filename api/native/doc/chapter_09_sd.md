# Security Domain API

The security-domain (SD) API opens a session to a partition and provisions
its security domain. A security-domain session (opened with
[`azihsm_sess_ex_open`](#azihsm_sess_ex_open)) is required to issue the
provisioning command in this chapter.

All policy-taking Rust APIs accept `&PartPolicy`, including partition
init/final and remote/peer backup operations. Policy remains an explicit
per-call input; partition and session opening are unchanged. Native C
params continue to carry the serialized 484-byte policy in an
`azihsm_buffer`. The native wrappers parse that image into `PartPolicy`
after validating output capacity, preserving size probes and returning
`AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT` for a wrong-length policy once outputs
are sufficiently sized. The C ABI and DDI wire format are unchanged.

## azihsm_sess_ex_open

Open a security-domain session to the device.

The session uses the API revision that was selected when the partition was
opened with [`azihsm_part_open`](#azihsm_part_open). `psk` must be a non-NULL
pointer to an [`azihsm_session_psk`](#azihsm_session_psk) selecting the role
slot; only its inner `psk` buffer may be NULL, which selects the partition
default PSK for the slot. A NULL `psk` pointer is rejected with
`AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`. The `session_type` selects the channel
integrity profile pinned for the session (see
[azihsm_session_ex_type](#azihsm_session_ex_type)), and a handle to the new
session is returned.

```cpp
azihsm_status azihsm_sess_ex_open(
    azihsm_handle dev_handle,
    const azihsm_session_psk *psk,
    azihsm_session_ex_type session_type,
    azihsm_handle *sess_handle
    );
```

**Parameters**

 | Parameter         | Name                                                | Description                                    |
 | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
 | [in] dev_handle   | [azihsm_handle](#azihsm_handle)                     | partition handle                               |
 | [in] psk          | const azihsm_session_psk *                          | PSK credential (non-NULL); inner `psk` buffer NULL = default |
 | [in] session_type | [azihsm_session_ex_type](#azihsm_session_ex_type)   | channel integrity profile to pin               |
 | [out] sess_handle | [azihsm_handle *](#azihsm_handle)                   | new security-domain session handle      &nbsp; |

**Returns**

`AZIHSM_STATUS_SUCCESS` on success, error code otherwise

### azihsm_session_psk

PSK credential for [`azihsm_sess_ex_open`](#azihsm_sess_ex_open): the PSK
slot plus an optional caller-supplied PSK. When the `psk` buffer is NULL,
the partition **default** PSK for the slot is used — required for the first
session, before the default is rotated via
[`azihsm_sess_ex_psk_change`](#azihsm_sess_ex_psk_change). After rotation,
point `psk` at the rotated 32-byte secret.

```cpp
struct azihsm_session_psk {
    uint8_t psk_id;
    const struct azihsm_buffer *psk;
};
```

 | Field  | Name                             | Description                                        |
 | ------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
 | psk_id | uint8_t                          | PSK slot: 0 = Crypto Officer, 1 = Crypto User      |
 | psk    | [azihsm_buffer*](#azihsm_buffer) | optional PSK (exactly 32 bytes); NULL = default PSK |

## azihsm_sess_ex_part_init

Provision a partition's security domain over a security-domain session.

Initializes the partition from the caller-supplied machine seed
(`mach_seed`) and unified partition policy (`part_policy`), together with
the partition-owner (`pota_thumbprint`), security-administrator
(`sata_thumbprint`), and optional secondary-owner (`sapota_thumbprint`)
trust-anchor thumbprints. On success it returns the partition's
certificate-signing request (`pta_csr`) and attestation report
(`pta_report`).

The provisioning inputs are grouped into an
[`azihsm_sess_ex_part_init_params`](#azihsm_sess_ex_part_init_params)
structure. `pta_csr` and `pta_report` are caller-provided output buffers:
on input `len` is the buffer capacity; on success `len` is set to the
number of bytes written. Because provisioning is a one-shot operation, an
undersized buffer (or a NULL `ptr` with `len == 0`) is rejected with
`AZIHSM_STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL` and `len` set to the maximum possible
output size **before** the partition is provisioned. The buffer is
validated up-front against a fixed upper bound, so the probe reports that
bound rather than the exact size for the current device — callers should
expect to allocate up to that maximum. The standard two-call size probe
(call once with a zero-length buffer to learn the required capacity, then
retry with a buffer of at least that size) is therefore safe for this
command. A NULL `ptr` with a non-zero `len` is rejected with
`AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

```cpp
azihsm_status azihsm_sess_ex_part_init(
    azihsm_handle sess_handle,
    const struct azihsm_sess_ex_part_init_params *params,
    struct azihsm_buffer *pta_csr,
    struct azihsm_buffer *pta_report
    );
```

**Parameters**

 | Parameter            | Name                                                                  | Description                                     |
 | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
 | [in] sess_handle     | [azihsm_handle](#azihsm_handle)                                       | security-domain session handle                  |
 | [in] params          | [azihsm_sess_ex_part_init_params*](#azihsm_sess_ex_part_init_params)   | provisioning input buffers                      |
 | [in, out] pta_csr    | [azihsm_buffer *](#azihsm_buffer)                                     | output buffer for the DER PKCS#10 CSR           |
 | [in, out] pta_report | [azihsm_buffer *](#azihsm_buffer)                                     | output buffer for the attestation report &nbsp; |

**Returns**

`AZIHSM_STATUS_SUCCESS` on success, error code otherwise

### azihsm_sess_ex_part_init_params

Partition-policy inputs use the name `part_policy` and appear first in the
provisioning, finalization, and security-domain backup input structures.
Callers must rebuild against the updated header: moving these fields changes
the C struct layouts, even though the function signatures are unchanged.

Provisioning input buffers for
[`azihsm_sess_ex_part_init`](#azihsm_sess_ex_part_init). Each field points
to an [azihsm_buffer](#azihsm_buffer); `sapota_thumbprint` is optional and
may be NULL to omit it.

```cpp
struct azihsm_sess_ex_part_init_params {
    const struct azihsm_buffer *part_policy;
    const struct azihsm_buffer *mach_seed;
    const struct azihsm_buffer *pota_thumbprint;
    const struct azihsm_buffer *sata_thumbprint;
    const struct azihsm_buffer *sapota_thumbprint;
};
```

 | Field             | Name                             | Description                              |
 | ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
 | part_policy       | [azihsm_buffer*](#azihsm_buffer) | unified partition policy image (see [Partition policy builder](#partition-policy-builder)) |
 | mach_seed         | [azihsm_buffer*](#azihsm_buffer) | machine seed plaintext                   |
 | pota_thumbprint   | [azihsm_buffer*](#azihsm_buffer) | POTA public-key thumbprint               |
 | sata_thumbprint   | [azihsm_buffer*](#azihsm_buffer) | SATA public-key thumbprint               |
 | sapota_thumbprint | [azihsm_buffer*](#azihsm_buffer) | optional SAPOTA thumbprint (may be NULL) |

## azihsm_sess_ex_part_final

Finalize a partition's security domain over a security-domain session.

Completes provisioning started by
[`azihsm_sess_ex_part_init`](#azihsm_sess_ex_part_init): re-supplies the
unified partition policy and the PTA certificate chain (root to leaf),
optionally restoring a prior `local_mk` backup, and returns the current
`local_mk` backup envelope the firmware produced.

The inputs are grouped into an
[`azihsm_sess_ex_part_final_params`](#azihsm_sess_ex_part_final_params)
structure. `local_mk_backup` is a caller-provided output buffer with the
same capacity/length contract and two-call size-probe behavior as the
`azihsm_sess_ex_part_init` outputs: an undersized buffer (or a NULL `ptr`
with `len == 0`) is rejected with `AZIHSM_STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL` and
`len` set to the maximum **before** the partition is finalized. A NULL
`ptr` with a non-zero `len` is rejected with
`AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

```cpp
azihsm_status azihsm_sess_ex_part_final(
    azihsm_handle sess_handle,
    const struct azihsm_sess_ex_part_final_params *params,
    struct azihsm_buffer *local_mk_backup
    );
```

**Parameters**

 | Parameter                 | Name                                                                      | Description                                  |
 | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
 | [in] sess_handle          | [azihsm_handle](#azihsm_handle)                                           | security-domain session handle               |
 | [in] params               | [azihsm_sess_ex_part_final_params*](#azihsm_sess_ex_part_final_params)     | finalization input buffers                   |
 | [in, out] local_mk_backup | [azihsm_buffer *](#azihsm_buffer)                                         | output buffer for the local_mk backup &nbsp; |

**Returns**

`AZIHSM_STATUS_SUCCESS` on success, error code otherwise

### azihsm_sess_ex_part_final_params

Finalization input buffers for
[`azihsm_sess_ex_part_final`](#azihsm_sess_ex_part_final). `pta_cert_chain`
points to an array of `pta_cert_chain_len` [azihsm_buffer](#azihsm_buffer)s,
each holding one DER-encoded PTA certificate (root to leaf; at most
`MAX_CERTS`). `prev_local_mk_backup` is optional and may be NULL to omit it.

The shared firmware requires the PTA certificate to preserve the exact
DER subject Name from the PTA CSR and to use SHA-1 of the uncompressed
SEC1 PTA public key as its Subject Key Identifier. The PTA certificate
must be a CA with `keyCertSign` usage. A certificate violating this profile
is rejected before finalization, even if its key and POTA signature are valid.

After successful finalization, certificate slot 2 exposes only the PTA-signed
PID certificate at index 0. Shared command code above PAL generates a fresh
certificate on each request using ordinary signing and the existing PTA and
PID keys. DER bytes and lengths can change between requests. Chain metadata
fingerprints an independently generated certificate, so its thumbprint need
not match a subsequent certificate read. Neither a certificate chain nor
issuer metadata is stored in firmware. The caller retains its POTA/PTA chain
and prepends it to this PID certificate to construct root-first evidence.
Slot 0's provisioning behavior is unchanged, though on the std PAL its leaf
certificate is not byte-for-byte identical: `fw/plat/std/pal/src/cert.rs`
now derives the slot-0 leaf serial from the PID key's SHA-1 identifier (the
same derivation as the slot-2 PID serial). Slot 1 remains unsupported.
Omitting the owner chain does not produce complete evidence for operations
requiring all three chains.

```cpp
struct azihsm_sess_ex_part_final_params {
    const struct azihsm_buffer *part_policy;
    const struct azihsm_buffer *pta_cert_chain;
    uint32_t pta_cert_chain_len;
    const struct azihsm_buffer *prev_local_mk_backup;
};
```

 | Field                | Name                             | Description                                     |
 | -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
 | part_policy          | [azihsm_buffer*](#azihsm_buffer) | unified partition policy (must match part_init) |
 | pta_cert_chain       | [azihsm_buffer*](#azihsm_buffer) | array of DER PTA certificates (root to leaf)    |
 | pta_cert_chain_len   | uint32_t                         | number of certificates in the chain             |
 | prev_local_mk_backup | [azihsm_buffer*](#azihsm_buffer) | optional prior local_mk backup (may be NULL)    |

## Partition policy builder

The `part_policy` image consumed by
[`azihsm_sess_ex_part_init`](#azihsm_sess_ex_part_init) and
[`azihsm_sess_ex_part_final`](#azihsm_sess_ex_part_final) is a fixed-size
binary layout. Rather than assemble it by hand, callers may use the
opaque partition-policy builder to set named, typed fields and then
serialize the canonical image. The on-wire format is unchanged — the
builder is a pure convenience that emits exactly the bytes the init /
final entry points already accept.

Typical use:

1. [`azihsm_part_policy_builder_new`](#azihsm_part_policy_builder_new)
   allocates a builder (its version defaults to `major = 1, minor = 0`,
   with every other field zeroed).
2. Set both required POTA and SATA keys with the
   `azihsm_part_policy_builder_set_*` setters, plus any optional fields.
3. [`azihsm_part_policy_build`](#azihsm_part_policy_build) serializes the
   image into a caller-provided [azihsm_buffer](#azihsm_buffer); it
   follows the same two-call size-probe contract as other output buffers
   (an undersized buffer is rejected with
   `AZIHSM_STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL` and `len` set to the required size).
4. [`azihsm_part_policy_builder_free`](#azihsm_part_policy_builder_free)
   releases the builder.

The serialized image may then be passed as the `part_policy` buffer to
`azihsm_sess_ex_part_init` / `azihsm_sess_ex_part_final`.

### azihsm_part_policy_builder_new

Allocate a new partition-policy builder.

```cpp
azihsm_status azihsm_part_policy_builder_new(
    struct azihsm_part_policy_builder **out_builder);
```

**Parameters**

- `out_builder` — on success, receives a non-NULL opaque builder handle
  that must be released with `azihsm_part_policy_builder_free`. Left
  unmodified on failure.

**Returns**

`AZIHSM_STATUS_SUCCESS` on success, or `AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`
if `out_builder` is NULL.

### azihsm_part_policy_builder_free

Release a builder handle. Passing NULL is a no-op.

```cpp
void azihsm_part_policy_builder_free(
    struct azihsm_part_policy_builder *builder
    );
```

### azihsm_part_policy_builder_set_* 

Set individual policy fields. Each returns `AZIHSM_STATUS_SUCCESS`, or
`AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT` on a NULL handle or buffer. `kind` is the
public-key kind discriminant (`0` = ECC P-384).

Both POTA and SATA keys are mandatory: call
`azihsm_part_policy_builder_set_pota_key` and
`azihsm_part_policy_builder_set_sata_key` before building. If either key
is unset, `azihsm_part_policy_build` returns
`AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`, including for size probes.
SAPOTA and backing-partition keys remain optional.

Fixed-size fields reject input that does not satisfy their length
requirement rather than truncating or padding it: if a key, `info`, or
backing-partition id violates its slot's length rule, the setter still
returns `AZIHSM_STATUS_SUCCESS`, but the subsequent
`azihsm_part_policy_build` fails with `AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
A *known* key kind must be exactly the length that kind requires — an
ECC P-384 (`kind = 0`) key is `X || Y`, i.e. exactly 96 bytes — because
the firmware rejects every other length; a shorter key that merely fits
the slot is therefore rejected too. `info` and the backing-partition id
must not exceed their respective slots (truncating key material would
silently yield a *different* key).

The `flags` byte passed to `azihsm_part_policy_builder_set_flags` is a
bitfield:

| Bit   | Meaning                  |
|-------|--------------------------|
| 0     | `include_fmc_cdi`        |
| 1     | `require_trusted_sa_key` |
| 2     | `allow_peer_cloning`     |
| 3 – 7 | reserved (must be zero)  |

The major version must be 1; any minor version is accepted. Setting an
unsupported major version or any reserved flag bit still returns
`AZIHSM_STATUS_SUCCESS` from the setter, but
`azihsm_part_policy_build` rejects the policy with
`AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`, including during size probes.

```cpp
azihsm_status azihsm_part_policy_builder_set_version(
    struct azihsm_part_policy_builder *builder, uint8_t major, uint8_t minor);
azihsm_status azihsm_part_policy_builder_set_pota_key(
    struct azihsm_part_policy_builder *builder, uint16_t kind,
    const struct azihsm_buffer *key);
azihsm_status azihsm_part_policy_builder_set_sata_key(
    struct azihsm_part_policy_builder *builder, uint16_t kind,
    const struct azihsm_buffer *key);
azihsm_status azihsm_part_policy_builder_set_sapota_key(
    struct azihsm_part_policy_builder *builder, uint16_t kind,
    const struct azihsm_buffer *key);
azihsm_status azihsm_part_policy_builder_set_backup_part_id(
    struct azihsm_part_policy_builder *builder, const struct azihsm_buffer *id);
azihsm_status azihsm_part_policy_builder_set_backup_part_pub_key(
    struct azihsm_part_policy_builder *builder, uint16_t kind,
    const struct azihsm_buffer *key);
azihsm_status azihsm_part_policy_builder_set_info(
    struct azihsm_part_policy_builder *builder, const struct azihsm_buffer *info);
azihsm_status azihsm_part_policy_builder_set_flags(
    struct azihsm_part_policy_builder *builder, uint8_t flags);
```

### azihsm_part_policy_build

Serialize the policy into its canonical wire image.

```cpp
azihsm_status azihsm_part_policy_build(
    struct azihsm_part_policy_builder *builder,
    struct azihsm_buffer *out
    );
```

**Returns**

`AZIHSM_STATUS_SUCCESS` on success, `AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT` on a
NULL or misaligned handle or buffer, or `AZIHSM_STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL` if
`out` is too small (with `out.len` set to the required size).
Missing a required POTA or SATA key, or a previously recorded setter
validation error, also returns `AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
An unsupported major version or reserved flag bit also returns
`AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

## azihsm_sess_ex_psk_change

Rotate the calling session's own partition PSK.

Replaces the PSK of the slot implied by the session role (CO session → CO,
CU session → CU) with `new_psk`, sealed under the session key. This is
required **once** on a fresh partition to move past the default-PSK gate
before provisioning, and may also be used later to re-rotate. `new_psk`
must be exactly 32 bytes.

```cpp
azihsm_status azihsm_sess_ex_psk_change(
    azihsm_handle sess_handle,
    const struct azihsm_buffer *new_psk
    );
```

**Parameters**

 | Parameter        | Name                              | Description                              |
 | ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
 | [in] sess_handle | [azihsm_handle](#azihsm_handle)   | security-domain session handle           |
 | [in] new_psk     | [azihsm_buffer *](#azihsm_buffer) | new PSK buffer (exactly 32 bytes) &nbsp; |

**Returns**

`AZIHSM_STATUS_SUCCESS` on success, error code otherwise

## azihsm_sd_create_remote_backup

Create a new security domain and its remote backup over a security-domain
session.

Creates a security domain under the calling session's partition from the
unified partition policy, using the sender's masked SD-sealing key (from
`azihsm_key_gen`) and the receiver's attestation evidence, and returns the
three backups the firmware produces: the remote partition-owner-key backup
(an HPKE-Auth seal of BKS3, 161 bytes), the local partition-owner-key backup
(276 bytes), and the security-domain masking-key backup (260 bytes).

The inputs are grouped into an
[`azihsm_sd_create_remote_backup_params`](#azihsm_sd_create_remote_backup_params)
structure. All three output buffers follow the two-call size-probe contract:
an undersized buffer (or a NULL `ptr` with `len == 0`) is rejected with
`AZIHSM_STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL` and `len` set to the required size, and
every output buffer is validated **before** the one-shot domain-creation
command is issued, so a too-small buffer never consumes it. A NULL `params`
pointer is rejected with `AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Creating a domain
is a once-per-partition operation; a second create on an initialized
partition returns `AZIHSM_STATUS_SD_ALREADY_INITIALIZED`.

```cpp
azihsm_status azihsm_sd_create_remote_backup(
    azihsm_handle sess_handle,
    const struct azihsm_sd_create_remote_backup_params *params,
    struct azihsm_buffer *pok_remote_backup,
    struct azihsm_buffer *pok_local_backup,
    struct azihsm_buffer *sd_mk_backup
    );
```

**Parameters**

## azihsm_sd_reseal_remote_backup

Reseal an existing remote backup to a new recipient over a security-domain
session.

HPKE-opens the source remote backup with the receiver's masked SD-sealing
key (authenticated by the source sender in `src_evidence`) and reseals the
recovered backup to the destination receiver (`dest_evidence`), returning the
resealed remote backup (161 bytes).

The inputs are grouped into an
[`azihsm_sd_reseal_remote_backup_params`](#azihsm_sd_reseal_remote_backup_params)
structure. `dst_remote_backup` follows the same two-call size-probe contract
as the create outputs and is validated **before** the reseal is performed. A
NULL `params` pointer is rejected with `AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

```cpp
azihsm_status azihsm_sd_reseal_remote_backup(
    azihsm_handle sess_handle,
    const struct azihsm_sd_reseal_remote_backup_params *params,
    struct azihsm_buffer *dst_remote_backup

## azihsm_sd_restore_remote_backup

Restore a security domain from a remote backup over a security-domain
session.

HPKE-opens the remote backup with the receiver's masked SD-sealing key
(authenticated by the sender in `sender_evidence`), recovers the
security-domain masking key from `prev_sd_mk_backup`, and returns the
refreshed device-local backups: the local partition-owner-key backup
(276 bytes) and the security-domain masking-key backup (260 bytes).

The inputs are grouped into an
[`azihsm_sd_restore_remote_backup_params`](#azihsm_sd_restore_remote_backup_params)
structure. Both output buffers follow the two-call size-probe contract and
are validated **before** the restore is performed. A NULL `params` pointer
is rejected with `AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Restore is a
once-per-partition operation; a restore on an already-initialized partition
returns `AZIHSM_STATUS_SD_ALREADY_INITIALIZED`.

```cpp
azihsm_status azihsm_sd_restore_remote_backup(
    azihsm_handle sess_handle,
    const struct azihsm_sd_restore_remote_backup_params *params,
    struct azihsm_buffer *pok_local_backup,
    struct azihsm_buffer *sd_mk_backup

## azihsm_sd_create_peer_backup

Create a peer-transferable backup of a security domain over a
security-domain session.

Recovers BKS3 from `pok_local_backup` and HPKE-Auth-seals it to the
destination peer named by `dst_evidence` (authenticated by the sender's
masked SD-sealing key), returning the peer backup (161 bytes). Peer
cloning is gated by the security domain's `allow_peer_cloning` policy flag.

The inputs are grouped into an
[`azihsm_sd_create_peer_backup_params`](#azihsm_sd_create_peer_backup_params)
structure. The output buffer follows the two-call size-probe contract and
is validated **before** the peer backup is created. A NULL `params` pointer
is rejected with `AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

```cpp
azihsm_status azihsm_sd_create_peer_backup(

## azihsm_sd_restore_local_backup

Restore a security domain from its device-local backups over a
security-domain session.

Restores the security domain from the device-local partition-owner-key
backup and security-domain masking-key backup, returning the refreshed
device-local backups: the local partition-owner-key backup (276 bytes) and
the security-domain masking-key backup (260 bytes). Unlike the remote/peer
restores, this carries no attestation evidence — the backups are masked
under the device-local key.

The inputs are grouped into an
[`azihsm_sd_restore_local_backup_params`](#azihsm_sd_restore_local_backup_params)
structure. Both output buffers follow the two-call size-probe contract and
are validated **before** the restore is performed. A NULL `params` pointer
is rejected with `AZIHSM_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Restore is a
once-per-partition operation; a restore on an already-initialized partition
returns `AZIHSM_STATUS_SD_ALREADY_INITIALIZED`.

```cpp
azihsm_status azihsm_sd_restore_local_backup(

### azihsm_sd_cert_chain

One certificate chain in an SD attestation-evidence party: an array of `len`
[azihsm_buffer](#azihsm_buffer)s, each holding one DER-encoded certificate
ordered root to leaf (at most `EVIDENCE_CHAIN_MAX_CERTS`).

```cpp
struct azihsm_sd_cert_chain {
    const struct azihsm_buffer *certs;
    uint32_t len;
};
```
