// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

//! Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) trait for the HSM PAL.
//!
//! Defines [`EccCurve`] and the [`HsmEcc`] trait that PAL implementations
//! use to expose ECC key generation, raw EC sign/verify, and ECDSA
//! sign/verify operations.
//!
//! **Status**: The trait is defined but not yet included in the
//! [`HsmCrypto`] supertrait bound — no PAL implements it yet. It will
//! be wired in when the `EccSign`, `EccGenerateKeyPair`, and
//! `EcdhKeyExchange` DDI handlers are implemented in `fw/core`.
//!
//! ## Output buffer convention
//!
//! All methods that produce output take mandatory `&mut` parameters.
//! The caller is responsible for providing buffers of the correct size.
//! Use [`EccCurve::priv_key_len`], [`EccCurve::pub_key_len`],
//! [`EccCurve::sig_len`], and [`EccCurve::secret_len`] to determine
//! the required sizes.
//!
//! ## Raw EC vs ECDSA
//!
//! - **`ecc_sign` / `ecc_verify`** — Raw EC operations on a pre-computed
//!   hash digest. The caller is responsible for hashing the message first.
//! - **`ecdsa_sign` / `ecdsa_verify`** — Full ECDSA with algorithm
//!   selection. The implementation hashes internally using `hash_algo`.
