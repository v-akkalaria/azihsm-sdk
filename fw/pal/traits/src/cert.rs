//! Certificate store types and traits.
//!
//! Defines the [`HsmCertStore`] trait used by DDI handlers
//! (`get_cert_chain_info`, `get_certificate`) to read per-partition
//! certificate chains.  Each partition can hold multiple chains
//! addressed by a `slot_id` (e.g. slot 0 = identity chain, slot 1 =
//! attestation chain — exact slot mapping is platform-defined).
//!
//! ## Storage model
//!
//! A *chain* is an ordered list of DER-encoded X.509 certificates,
//! conventionally arranged leaf-first.  The store reports two pieces
//! of metadata per chain via [`CertChainInfo`]:
//!
//! - the chain length (`count`), and
//! - the SHA-256 thumbprint of the leaf certificate.
//!
//! Individual certificates are streamed one at a time through
//! [`HsmCertStore::get_cert`] using the standard query/copy pattern.
//!
//! ## Addressing
//!
//! Every method takes both an [`HsmIo`] handle and an explicit
//! [`HsmPartId`].  Unlike most PAL traits, the partition is *not*
//! resolved from `io.pid()` here: the cert store is read by core
//! partition-management paths that need to inspect *another*
//! partition's chains (for example, returning the host's own
//! identity-cert metadata in a query that arrived on partition 0).
//! The [`HsmIo`] handle is still passed for per-IO scope (allocator,
//! logging, throttling).
