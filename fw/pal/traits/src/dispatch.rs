//! Platform hook for commands the core does not implement.
//!
//! Both DDI dispatchers reject an opcode they do not recognise with
//! [`HsmError::UnsupportedCmd`](crate::HsmError::UnsupportedCmd). That is the right answer for a
//! production build, but it leaves no way for a platform to add commands
//! that exist purely to drive testing — crash injection, fault
//! injection, and similar.
//!
//! [`HsmCustomDispatch`] gives the platform one place to intercept an
//! otherwise-unsupported opcode.
//!
//! # When the hook is called, and what that requires of an implementer
//!
//! The two protocols reach the hook by different routes, and only one of
//! them can promise the opcode was unknown.
//!
//! **TBOR** consults the hook only when `is_known_opcode` has already
//! failed, so a TBOR hook genuinely cannot shadow a core command.
//!
//! **MBOR** consults the hook when core dispatch returns
//! [`UnsupportedCmd`](crate::HsmError::UnsupportedCmd). That is normally
//! the "no handler matched" answer, but it is not exclusively so: a
//! handler for a *known* opcode may also return it — `rsa_unwrap` does,
//! for an unsupported key type. So an MBOR hook can occasionally be
//! offered a request the core did recognise.
//!
//! **An implementer must therefore claim by opcode, and claim only
//! opcodes the core has no handler for.** Matching on the opcode and
//! returning `UnsupportedCmd` for everything else — as uno's
//! `test_dispatch` does — satisfies this. A hook that answered
//! unconditionally would shadow real commands.
//!
//! The alternative, a distinct "unknown opcode" signal out of MBOR
//! dispatch, was considered and rejected: it changes the core's
//! signature away from mainline's, and any second copy of the opcode
//! table needed to distinguish the two cases would rot.
//!
//! # The hook sits behind the IO layer's session checks
//!
//! Both protocols validate session shape before the hook is reached, and
//! an unknown opcode is classified by a fall-through arm in each. The
//! two arms disagree, so the preconditions are **opposite** — this is
//! the detail most likely to cost an implementer an afternoon.
//!
//! **MBOR** — an opcode the core does not know is classified
//! `DdiSessionKind::User` (the `_` arm of `From<DdiOp> for
//! DdiSessionKind`), and `validate_session` / `validate_session_live`
//! run before dispatch. A custom MBOR command is therefore **an
//! in-session command whether or not it wants to be**: sent without a
//! live session it fails validation and surfaces as that error, never
//! reaching the hook. `mcr-hsm`'s `TestAction` callers already open a
//! session first.
//!
//! **TBOR** — an unknown opcode is classified `SessionCtrl::NoSession`
//! (the `_` arm of `SessionCtrl::from_tbor_opcode`), and
//! `handle_tbor_op` runs `validate_tbor_session_flags` before
//! `ddi::tbor::dispatch`. A custom TBOR command must therefore be sent
//! with **sessionless SQE flags** — `ctrl == NoSession` and
//! `id_valid` clear — or it is rejected with `InvalidArg` before the
//! hook. The reverse of the MBOR rule.
//!
//! In both cases the failure is misleading: it looks like a session
//! problem rather than anything to do with the custom command.
//!
//! # Everything about such a command stays below the PAL
//!
//! MBOR and TBOR are host **API contracts**, and the layering runs
//! DDI handlers -> PAL trait -> platform adapters -> drivers. A
//! test-only command must not perforate that: nothing above the PAL may
//! know a `TestAction` exists, and no build above the PAL may be
//! feature-gated on it.
//!
//! So the hook is deliberately **opaque**. The core hands over the
//! untouched request buffer and gets back an encoded response; it never
//! learns the opcode, the request shape, or whether the platform even
//! claimed it. The opcode is not in any core table, the wire types are
//! not in any core crate, and the feature flag that turns the command on
//! lives in the uno PAL alone.
//!
//! The cost is that an implementer decodes the envelope and header for
//! itself, duplicating work the core already did for MBOR. That is the
//! price of the core staying oblivious, and it is what keeps the two
//! protocols' hooks identical in shape.
//!
//! # Contract
//!
//! The hook returns the encoded response as a slice borrowed from the
//! PAL's per-IO allocator, exactly as the core's own handlers do.
//!
//! Returning the slice — rather than filling a buffer the core
//! pre-allocates — is what keeps this cheap. The implementer allocates
//! *after* any `await`, so it can use
//! [`HsmAlloc::dma_alloc_var`](crate::HsmAlloc::dma_alloc_var), which
//! hands over the remaining watermark and returns the unused tail to the
//! pool. Pre-allocating a worst-case buffer for the hook to fill would
//! instead pin the per-IO high-water mark at that maximum, and that mark
//! drives the teardown scrub.
//!
//! Note an `async fn` may call `dma_alloc_var` freely; only `await`-ing
//! *inside* the closure is disallowed. Doing the asynchronous work first
//! and encoding afterwards is therefore the natural shape.
//!
//! # No default implementations
//!
//! Both methods are required. A platform that adds no test commands says
//! so explicitly by returning [`HsmError::UnsupportedCmd`](crate::HsmError::UnsupportedCmd) — see
//! `StdHsmPal`, which does exactly that for both protocols.
//!
//! Defaults would be shorter, but they make "this platform claims
//! nothing" the silent outcome of writing no code, which is the wrong
//! default for a hook whose entire purpose is to let a platform answer
//! commands the core refuses. Requiring the impl also means adding a
//! protocol to this trait breaks every platform until each one has
//! considered it.
