// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

//! HSM Key Vault types and trait.
//!
//! Defines the key management interface for the HSM firmware. The vault
//! stores cryptographic keys in protected memory (SRAM on Cortex-M7,
//! heap on the standard PAL) and tracks their type, attributes, and
//! per-key attributes.
//!
//! ## Key lifecycle
//!
//! ```text
//! vault_key_create(key_bytes, kind, session, attrs) → key_id
//!   ↓
//! vault_key(key_id)       → &[u8] key material
//! vault_key_kind(key_id)  → HsmVaultKeyKind
//! vault_key_attrs(key_id) → HsmVaultKeyAttrs
//!   ↓
//! vault_key_delete(key_id)
//! vault_key_delete_by_session(session_id)
//! vault_clear()
//! ```
//!
//! ## Key identifiers
//!
//! Each key is assigned a [`HsmKeyId`] (`u16` newtype) on creation.
//! This ID is used in all subsequent DDI operations (sign, encrypt,
//! delete, etc.) to reference the key without exposing key material.
//!
//! ## Key attributes
//!
//! [`HsmVaultKeyAttrs`] is a 64-bit bitfield encoding PKCS#11-inspired
//! properties (encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify, wrap, unwrap, derive)
//! plus HSM-specific flags (internal, session-scoped, extractable).
//! These are set at creation time and govern which operations are
//! permitted on the key.
