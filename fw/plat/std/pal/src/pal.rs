//! Standard (host-native) Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL).
//!
//! This module defines [`StdHsmPal`], the host-native PAL that runs on a
//! standard OS (Linux/Windows) using tokio for async scheduling. It
//! implements the [`HsmPal`] supertrait, which bundles:
//!
//! - [`HsmIoController`] — IO request receive / completion send (via channels)
//! - [`HsmGdmaController`] — memory copy (simulated, no real DMA hardware)
//! - [`HsmCrypto`] — cryptographic primitives (delegates to `HsmRng`)
//! - [`HsmPartitionManager`] — partition queries (currently stubbed)
//!
//! On a real Cortex-M7 target, a different PAL implementation would be
//! selected at compile time via the `pal-std` feature flag in
//! `azihsm_fw_hsm_core`.
//!
//! ## Ownership model
//!
//! `StdHsmPal` can be constructed in two ways:
//!
//! 1. **[`new`](StdHsmPal::new)** — caller provides channel endpoints and a
//!    tokio handle. The caller owns the runtime; `StdHsmPal` borrows it via
//!    the handle.
//!
//! 2. **[`Default`]** — creates its own single-threaded tokio runtime and
//!    dummy channels. Used primarily for trait-bound satisfaction in tests and
//!    default construction. The runtime is held in `_rt` to keep the handle
//!    valid for the PAL's lifetime.
//!
//! ## IO flow
//!
//! ```text
//! Host → [async_channel] → StdIic (iic) → core processes IO → StdOic (oic) → [async_channel] → Host
//!                                              ↕
//!                                         StdGdma (gdma)
//!                                     (simulated DMA copy)
//! ```
