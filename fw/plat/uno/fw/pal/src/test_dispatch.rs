//! Test-only DDI commands, reached through the
//! [`HsmCustomDispatch`](azihsm_fw_hsm_pal_traits::HsmCustomDispatch)
//! PAL hook.
//!
//! The core matches an incoming opcode against its own handlers first,
//! and offers the request here when that yields `UnsupportedCmd`. That
//! status usually means "no handler matched", but not always — a handler
//! for a known opcode can return it too — so this module claims strictly
//! by opcode and answers `UnsupportedCmd` for anything else, which is
//! what keeps it from shadowing a real command. This is where uno adds
//! commands that exist purely to drive testing.
//!
//! Nothing above the PAL knows any of this exists: the opcode is in no
//! core table, the wire types are in no core crate, and `mcr_test_action`
//! — the feature that turns the command on — is declared in this crate
//! alone. Without it this module is compiled out and uno's
//! `mbor_dispatch` rejects every opcode, so a production build answers
//! exactly as it would if the hook had never been added.
//!
//! # `TestAction` is an in-session command
//!
//! The core classifies any opcode it does not know as
//! `DdiSessionKind::User`, and the IO layer runs session validation
//! before dispatch. So a `TestAction` sent without a live session fails
//! that check and never reaches this module — it surfaces as a session
//! error rather than anything from here. `mcr-hsm`'s host-side callers
//! already open a session first, so this is a constraint to know about
//! rather than one to work around.
//!
//! # Wire compatibility
//!
//! `TestAction` (`DdiOp` 2004) and its request types mirror `mcr-hsm`'s
//! definitions field-for-field, so the existing host-side crash suite
//! drives either firmware unchanged.
//!
//! Only the subset uno can act on is decoded. Every other opcode, and
//! every other `DdiTestAction`, returns [`HsmError::UnsupportedCmd`] —
//! the same answer the hook's default gives, so those are
//! indistinguishable from the hook not existing.
//!
//! A request that *is* claimed can still fail with a different status: a
//! malformed body gives [`HsmError::DdiDecodeFailed`], and a
//! `TriggerCrash` missing its `crash_info` gives
//! [`HsmError::InvalidArg`]. Those two are the only externally visible
//! evidence that this module is compiled in at all, which makes them
//! useful for checking a build without crashing it.
