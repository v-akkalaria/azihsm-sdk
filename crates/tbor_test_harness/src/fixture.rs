//! Backend setup, role-session bootstrap helpers, and canonical fixture
//! constants shared by every TBOR integration test.
//!
//! Calling [`open_dev`] does three things, in order:
//!
//! 1. Acquires the process-global `TEST_LOCK` (held for the
//!    returned handle's lifetime). The `StdHsm` is a single shared
//!    instance for the whole test binary, so any in-flight FW work
//!    from another test would be corrupted by this one's `erase`.
//! 2. Opens the device advertised by the configured backend
//!    (`emu` or `mock`).
//! 3. Factory-resets the device on every backend that owns partition
//!    state (all but `mock`) so every test starts from byte-identical
//!    state — no inherited session slots, no inherited PSK rotations,
//!    no implicit ordering dependency on other tests' cleanup
//!    discipline.
//!
//! Tests therefore become self-contained by construction. The
//! returned [`TestDev`] wraps the backend handle in a type that
//! `Deref`s to the underlying `<AzihsmDdi as Ddi>::Dev`, so existing
//! call sites (`let dev = open_dev(); helper(&dev, ...)`) keep
//! compiling without modification — deref coercion supplies the
//! `&<Dev>` automatically.
