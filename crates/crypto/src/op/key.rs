//! Traits for cryptographic key type system and operations.
//!
//! This module provides trait definitions for key type markers and basic key operations
//! including import and export. These traits support various key types (symmetric,
//! asymmetric) and provide a consistent interface across different algorithms.
//!
//! # Design Philosophy
//!
//! The module uses a marker trait hierarchy to provide compile-time type safety for
//! cryptographic operations. This prevents common mistakes like using the wrong key
//! type with an operation.
//!
//! # Trait Categories
//!
//! The module provides several categories of traits:
//!
//! - **Base Traits**: [`Key`] as the root trait for all key types
//! - **Key Type Markers**: [`SymmetricKey`], [`PrivateKey`], [`PublicKey`], [`SecretKey`] for type classification
//! - **Operation Markers**: [`SigningKey`], [`VerificationKey`], [`EncryptionKey`], [`DecryptionKey`]
//! - **Key Wrapping**: [`WrappingKey`], [`UnwrappingKey`] for key transport and storage
//! - **Key Transfer**: [`ExportableKey`], [`ImportableKey`] for serialization capabilities
//! - **Derivation**: [`DerivationKey`] for key derivation operations
//! - **Import/Export Operations**: [`KeyImportOp`] and [`KeyExportOp`] for serialization
//!
//! # Key Types
//!
//! Keys are categorized by their cryptographic role:
//! - **Symmetric Keys**: Secret keys used for encryption/HMAC (e.g., AES, HMAC keys)
//! - **Private Keys**: Asymmetric private keys for signing/decryption (e.g., RSA, ECC private keys)
//! - **Public Keys**: Asymmetric public keys for verification/encryption (e.g., RSA, ECC public keys)

/// Base trait for all cryptographic keys.
///
/// This trait serves as the foundational marker for all key types in the library,
/// establishing that a type can be imported from and exported to byte representations.
/// All key types (symmetric, private, public) must implement this trait.
///
/// # Requirements
///
/// Keys implementing this trait automatically support:
/// - Import operations via [`KeyImportOp`] bound
/// - Export operations via [`KeyExportOp`] bound
///
/// # Key Type Hierarchy
///
/// The trait hierarchy includes these specialized key types:
/// - [`SymmetricKey`]: Symmetric/secret keys for algorithms like AES, HMAC
/// - [`PrivateKey`]: Asymmetric private keys for signing and decryption
/// - [`PublicKey`]: Asymmetric public keys for verification and encryption
/// - [`SecretKey`]: Marker for secret key material
/// - [`DerivationKey`]: Keys that can be used in key derivation operations
///
/// # Operation Markers
///
/// Keys may also implement operation-specific markers:
/// - [`SigningKey`]: Can create digital signatures
/// - [`VerificationKey`]: Can verify digital signatures
/// - [`EncryptionKey`]: Can encrypt data
/// - [`DecryptionKey`]: Can decrypt data
/// - [`WrappingKey`]: Can wrap other keys
/// - [`UnwrappingKey`]: Can unwrap other keys
/// - [`ExportableKey`]: Can be exported
/// - [`ImportableKey`]: Can be imported

/// # Type Safety
///
/// This marker trait enables compile-time verification that the correct key type

/// - Rotated according to security policy
