//! `PartFinal` chain-integrity rejects.
//!
//! These are the two cases that need a **well-formed but wrong** PTA
//! chain, so they are the only tests that must reach
//! `validate_pta_chain` with something for it to reject: a chain not
//! anchored to the policy's POTA key, and a chain whose terminal
//! certificate carries the wrong PTA key.
//!
//! They assert the specific `TborStatus` rather than calling bare
//! `expect_err`. That matters more than it looks: these tests began life
//! `#[cfg(feature = "emu")]` with a bare `expect_err`, which passed
//! happily while the out-of-band transport was returning a DMA fault —
//! failing for a reason that had nothing to do with the chain.
//!
//! Certificates travel **out of band**, and both transports now
//! implement that: `ddi/emu` writes the metadata page directly, and
//! `ddi/nix` hands the items to the driver's data-transfer ioctl, which
//! DMA-maps them and builds the page in the kernel. So these run on
//! `emu` **and hardware**.
//!
//! Everything else about `PartFinal` — the happy path, backup restore,
//! lifecycle and role gates — lives in [`super`], which also carries a
//! real chain on both backends. The gates that fire *before* the chain
//! walk live in [`super::fw_rejects`].
